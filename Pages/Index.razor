    <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
    <p>
        This Naming Tool was developed using a naming pattern based on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging">
            Microsoft's
            best
            practices
        </a>, and uses a PowerShell script to define your organization’s preferred naming
        configuration. Once the organizational components have been defined, CSV files are used to further
        define the values for Azure naming components. These values are imported and hard coded into a
        JavaScript object for reference documentation.
    </p>
    <p><strong>API:</strong> <a href="@(MyNavigationManager.Uri)swagger/index.html" target="_blank">@(MyNavigationManager.Uri)swagger/index.html</a></p>
    <p>
        If you need to modify any of the values, you must modify only the CSV files, and then re-run the
        PowerShell script. This will recreate the HTML file for reference.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further documentation on the script can be found on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/tree/master/ready/AzNamingTool">Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework GitHub repo</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Configuration</h4>
    <p>
        The Configuration tab provides data collected from the PowerShell script. Some of this data is static,
        while some of it was input based on your organization’s responses while running the configuration
        script. These values are all surfaced in the Generator tool, and can be used to create a custom name for
        an Azure resource.
    </p>

    <h4>References</h4>
    <p>
        The References tab provides examples for each type of Azure resource. The example values do not include
        any excluded naming components. Optional components are always displayed and are identified below the
        example . Since unique names are only required at specific scopes, the examples provided are only
        generated for the scopes above the resource scope: resource group, resource group & region, region,
        global, subscription, and tenant.
    </p>

    <h4>Generator</h4>
    <p>
        The Generator tab provides a drop down menu to select an Azure resource. Once a resource is selected,
        naming component options are provided. Read-only components cannot be changed, like the value for a
        resource type or organization. Optional components, if left blank, will be null and not shown in the
        output. Required components do not allow a null value, and the first value in the array is set as the
        default.
